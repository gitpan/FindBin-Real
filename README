NAME
    FindBin::Real - Locate directory of original perl script

SYNOPSIS
     use FindBin::Real;
     use lib FindBin::Real::Bin() . '/../lib';

     or

     use FindBin::Real qw(Bin);
     use lib Bin() . '/../lib';

DESCRIPTION
    Locates the full path to the script bin directory to allow the use of
    paths relative to the bin directory.

    This allows a user to setup a directory tree for some software with
    directories <root>/bin and <root>/lib and then the above example will
    allow the use of modules in the lib directory without knowing where the
    software tree is installed.

    If perl is invoked using the -e option or the perl script is read from
    "STDIN" then FindBin sets both "Bin()" and "RealBin()" return values to
    the current directory.

EXPORTABLE FUNCTIONS
     Bin         - path to bin directory from where script was invoked
     Script      - basename of script from which perl was invoked
     RealBin     - Bin() with all links resolved
     RealScript  - Script() with all links resolved
     BinDepth(n) - path to n-level parent directory

KNOWN ISSUES
    If there are two modules using "FindBin::Real" from different
    directories under the same interpreter, this WOULD work. Since
    "FindBin::Real" uses functions instead of "BEGIN" block in "FindBin",
    it'll be executed on every script, and all callers will get it right.
    This module can be used under mod_perl and other persistent Perl
    environments, where you shouldn't use "FindBin".

KNOWN BUGS
    If perl is invoked as

       perl filename

    and *filename* does not have executable rights and a program called
    *filename* exists in the users $ENV{PATH} which satisfies both -x and -T
    then FindBin assumes that it was invoked via the $ENV{PATH}.

    Workaround is to invoke perl as

     perl ./filename
